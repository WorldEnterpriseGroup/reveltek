# Welcome to HIPAA training brought to you by Compliancy Group
Employee training provides guidance on the permitted uses and disclosure of protected health information, how to protect that information, and what to do if a breach occurs.
## What is HIPAA?
HIPAA stands for: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which is a series of national standards that healthcare organizations must have in place in order to safeguard the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI).
- ### What is Protected Health Information (PHI)?
PHI is any demographic individually identifiable information that can be used to identify a patient.
Some common PHI identifiers are:
| Common PHI Identifiers |
|------------------------|
| Name                   |
| Date of Birth          |
| Address                |
| Social Security Number |
| Phone Number           |
| Medical Record Number  |
| Health Plan Beneficiary Number |
| Email Address          |
| Photographs or Images  |
| Biometric Data         |

- ### Who needs to be HIPAA compliant?
If you work in healthcare in any capacity, you need to be HIPAA compliant. There are two types of organizations who need to be HIPAA compliant,
  - Covered Entities : Covered Entities are involved in the direct creation of PHI and must be compliant with the full extent of HIPAA regulation.
HIPAA regulation defines a covered entity as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses involved in the transmission of protected health information (PHI).
  - Business Associates: A business associate is any organization hired by a covered entity (or another business associate) who will encounter PHI over the course of work they’ve been hired to perform.
Some common examples of business associates are:

| Business Associate | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| MSPs               | Managed Service Providers that provide IT services to covered entities. |
| EHR Providers      | Electronic Health Record Providers that provide software for managing patient data. |
| Medical Billing Services | Third-party services that handle billing and payment processing for healthcare providers. |
| Cloud Storage Providers | Companies that offer cloud-based data storage services. |
| Attorneys           | Legal professionals who may provide advice on HIPAA compliance and other legal matters. |
| Shredding Services  | Third-party services that securely dispose of paper records and other sensitive information. |


## 3 HIPAA rules, cybersecurity best practices and what is required to become HIPAA compliant.
- HIPAA rules: 
  - Privacy Rule
  - Security Rule
  - Breach Notification & Omnibus Rule

- ### Privacy Rule
HIPAA guidelines are identified and defined in a series of interlocking regulations known as the HIPAA Rules. One of these rules is known as the HIPAA Privacy Rule. HIPAA privacy guidelines are defined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. These HIPAA guidelines include national standards that all covered entities must address within their business. These standards are meant to safeguard the privacy of patient data, called protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA.
- What information does the HIPAA privacy rule protect? 
The Privacy Rule protects protected health information from unauthorized use or disclosure. 
  - What is “USE”?
USE means, with respect to individually identifiable health information, the:
    - Sharing
    - Employment
    - Application
    - Utilization
    - Examination
    - Analysis
  - What is “Disclosure”?
Disclosure means the release, transfer, or  provision of access to, any manner of information outside the covered entity holding that information.
- ### HIPAA Security Rule 
The HIPAA Security Rule is meant to protect electronic PHI (ePHI).
The Security Rule requires appropriate safeguards to be in place to maintain the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of ePHI.
Healthcare organizations must implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to secure patient information.
  - Physical Safeguards: protect the physical security of your offices where PHI or ePHI may be stored or maintained. Common examples of physical safeguards include alarm systems, security systems, and locking areas where PHI or ePHI is stored.
  - Technical Safeguards: protect the cybersecurity of your business. Technical cybersecurity safeguards must be implemented in order to protect the ePHI that is maintained by your business. Examples of technical safeguards include firewalls, encryption, and data backup.
  - Administrative Safeguards: ensure that staff members are properly trained in order to execute the security measures you have in place. Administrative safeguards should include policies and procedures that document the security safeguards you have in place, as well as employee training on those policies and procedures to ensure that they are being properly executed.
- ### Breach Notification and Omnibus Rule 
The Breach Notification Rule outlines the processes that HIPAA-beholden entities must follow in the event of a data breach
This requires covered entities, following the discovery of a breach of unsecured PHI, to notify each person affected. 
If a breach affects 500 or more individuals, covered entities must notify the Department of Health and Human Services without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 days following a breach.
If a breach affects LESS than 500 individuals, the covered entity may notify on an annual basis.
  - Omnibus Rule: 
The HIPAA Omnibus Rule mandates that business associates must be HIPAA compliant and also outlines the rules surrounding Business Associate Agreements (BAAs).
Business Associate Agreements are contracts that must be executed between a covered entity and business associate–or between two business associates–before ANY PHI or ePHI can be transferred or shared. 

- ### Cybersecurity Best Practices.
  - What is Cybersecurity? 
Cybersecurity is a common term used to describe a set of practices, measures, and/or actions you can take to protect personal information and your computer from attacks.
Some common cyber threats are hackers, identity thieves, and malware.
In addition to these risks, your organization may face a number of other consequences, if you fail to take actions to protect personal information and your computer.
Some of these consequences are:
    - Fines from the state and federal government.
    - Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of valuable organizational data, research and/or personal electronic data.
    - Lawsuits, loss of public trust, protection, internal disciplinary action or termination of employment.
  - How to prevent cyber attacks:
    - Employee training: employees should not be using their work computers for personal reasons or opening email links from unfamiliar sources.
    - Secure systems: organizations should encrypt data, install firewalls, endpoint protection, antivirus, and update systems periodically.
    - Monitor network: file access and network traffic should be monitored to ensure that unauthorized users are not accessing sensitive data.
    - Backup data: allows systems to be restored in the event of a breach. Without data backup, an organization is at risk for a ransomware attack.
  - Be sure to… 
    - Be wary of invitations to download software from unknown internet sources
    - Watch for allusions to malware in user agreements before installing free software programs
  - Protect your passwords…
    - Do not share your passwords, and always make new passwords that are difficult to guess by avoiding dictionary words, and mixing letters, numbers, and punctuation.
These are just some of the recommended cybersecurity best practices to protect your business from cyber attacks. 

- ### what is required for HIPAA compliance 
Now that you have a sense for the foundations of HIPAA, we’ll take a dive into what’s necessary for your practice to effectively comply with the law.
  - STEP 1: Audits 
    - The first step in any effective compliance program is to execute a series of audits. These audits will give you a baseline of where your practice stands against HIPAA law. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to conduct annual audits of their organization to assess Administrative, Technical, and Physical gaps in compliance with HIPAA Privacy and Security standards. Under HIPAA, a Security Risk Assessment is NOT ENOUGH to be compliant–it’s only one essential audit that HIPAA-beholden entities are required to perform in order to maintain their compliance year-over-year.
 - STEP 2: Remediation Plans
   - Once covered entities and business associates have identified their gaps in compliance through these self-audits, they must implement remediation plans to reverse compliance violations. These remediation plans must be fully documented and include calendar dates by which gaps will be remediated. 
 - STEP 3: Policies and procedures
   - Covered entities and business associates must develop Policies and Procedures corresponding to HIPAA regulatory standards as outlined by the HIPAA Rules. These policies and procedures must be regularly updated to account for changes to the organization. Annual staff training on these Policies and Procedures is required, along with documented employee attestation stating that staff has read and understood each of the organization’s policies and procedures. 
 - STEP 4: Documentation
   - HIPAA-beholden organizations must document ALL efforts they take to become HIPAA compliant. This documentation is critical during a HIPAA investigation with HHS to pass strict HIPAA audits.
 - STEP 5: Business Associate Management
   - Covered entities and business associates must document all vendors with whom they share PHI in any way, and execute Business Associate Agreements. Business associate agreements must be signed before PHI is shared. This ensures PHI is handled securely and mitigates liability.  
 - STEP 6: Incident Management
   - If a covered entity or business associate has a data breach, they must have a process to document the breach and notify patients that their data has been compromised in accordance with the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.
